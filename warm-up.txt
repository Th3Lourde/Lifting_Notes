How to do a warm-up according to Jim Wendler:

Theory:
The goal of the wam-up is to get some blood flowing and to put your body in a position where you are able to lift some heavy weight safely. The heavier you can lift, the more important a warm-up is.

Example Warm-Ups:

Something that Jim recommends is the Agile 8, this can of course be googled, however here it is as described in the book:

IT Band foam roal x 10-15 passes per leg
Adductor foam roll x 10-15 passes per leg
Glute/pirifomis myofascial release; best done with a lacrosse ball or PVC pipe x 30 seconds per side
Rollovers into "V" sits x 10 reps
Fire hydrant circles, 10 forward and backward circles with each leg
Mountain climbers x 10 reps
Groiners x 10 reps, holding last rep for 10 seconds
Hip flexor stretch x 3 sets of 10 seconds per leg, perform all reps with one leg before switching to the other

Google is certainly helpful :D

Besides the agile 8, Jim also mentions the following warm-up template:

1) Something to get moving, 3-5 minutes of some form of cardio. The goal is not to get tired, just get the blood flowing for a bit. You can either do the cardio all at once or cycle it as will be shown below
2) Groin/Hips, done by moving to the side. Hurdle duck-unders, side shuffle, etc...
3) Bodyweight movement. Push-up, pull-up/chin-up, ab wheel or inch worm. 
4) Legs/hip flexors. Some kind of lunge.
5) Shoulder movement, band pull-apart or shoulder dislocate
6) Squat - fall into a deep squat and hold for 30 seconds

Example from the book:
1) Jump rope x 50
2) Hurdle Duck-Under x 5/side
3) Push-up x 3, hold bottom position for 3 seconds
4) Walking lunch x 5 reps/leg
5) Band pull-apart x 20
6) Squat x 30 seconds

Another example if you don't have equipment:
1) Jumping Jack x 25
2) Bodyweight squat x 30 second hold at bottom 
3) Push-up x 5, hold bottom position for 3-5 seconds
4) Bulgarian one-leg squat x 5/leg (hold bottom position for 5 seconds)
5) Hang from chin bar x 30 seconds
