After you do your general warm-up/mobility you do your throws and jumps.


Jim recommends doing 3-5 sets of 3-5 reps 

The goal is often that the box you finish on is higher than the box that you started on.

Jumps:
Box jumps
standing long jumps (jump for distance)



Jim recommends doing 15-20 throws per workout, the ball should weigh 10-12 pounds

Throw after your warm-up and before you begin lifting

Throws:
Standing overhead med ball throws
Standing backward med ball throws
Standing med ball chest passes
