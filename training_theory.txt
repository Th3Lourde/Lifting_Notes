Here is the general theory of the programs in 5/3/1:

Programming, programming, programming. There are the 5 general tenants of the theory behind the programs in 5/3/1, however this is a lower-level approach to the situation.

You usually program what you are going to be doing for the next 3-5 cycles.

A cycle can be one of two things: a leader or an anchor.

Leaders are usually characterized by high volume barbell work, low volume assistance, less jumps and throws, less hard conditioning, and an emphasis on easy conditioning. 

Anchors are usually characterized by a decrease in volume and increase in intensity. There is also an increase in assistance work, more jumps and throws, and more hard conditioning. Easy conditioning can also be done.

How many leaders/anchors?

3 leaders 2 anchors --> If you are a beginner or doing BBB
2 leaders 2 anchors --> Beginner/Intermediate
2 leaders 1 anchor  --> Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced 

Theory for current workout:
I am just starting up again. I have been lifting for a bit but have only been doing normal programming stuff. Time to hop on BBB for 3 cycles and get huge. 

1 cycle is three weeks

So three cycles of BBB, no deload :)

Another note: The %'s listed below are based upon my TM, which is 80-85% of my actual max. 

So my leader is BBB, about that:
There are two BBB templates in the book. One is meant for more experienced lifters, I am totally not there yet :)

Thus, here is what I am going to do:

M:
Warm-Up/Mobility
Jumps/Throws 10 total
Press 5/3/1
Press 5 x 10
Assistance

T:
Warm-Up/Mobility
Jumps/Throws 10 total
Squat 5/3/1
Squat 5 x 10
Assistance


Th:
Warm-Up/Mobility
Jumps/Throws 10 total
Bench 5/3/1
Bench 5 x 10
Assistance

F:
Warm-Up/Mobility
Jumps/Throws 10 total
DL 5/3/1
DL 5 x 10
Assistance

But wait but wait, wtf does 5/3/1 mean? 5 x 10 of what?
Refer to p.49 for reference


Week One:
70% x 5
80% x 5
90% x 5
5 x 10 @ 60%

Week Two:
65% x 5
75% x 5
85% x 5
5 x 10 @ 50%

Week Three:
75% x 5
85% x 5
95% x 5
5 x 10 @ 70%

So do this for 9 weeks, do the 7th week program, and then come back to this later.





What about when I finish my BBB cycles?
7th week protocol, find a new training max. This is talked about on p.20 of the book :)
